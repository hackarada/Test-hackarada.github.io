# SeBackup

Execution path: Read sensitve files with robocopy /b
Impact: Threat
Remarks: - May be more interesting if you can read %WINDIR%.DMP - SeBackupPrivilege (and robocopy) is not helpful when it comes to open files. - Robocopy requires both SeBackup and SeRestore to work with /b parameter.
Tool: Built-in commands
