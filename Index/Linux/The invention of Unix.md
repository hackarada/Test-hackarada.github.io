# The invention of Unix

In the 1960s and 1970s Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson invented Unix, arguably the worldâ€™s most important computer operating system. The legacy cannot be overstated, as Unix, its descendants and look-alikes, and its architecture can be found on most computers in existence today. Ritchie, Thompson, and later collaborators cooperated to foster the development and growth of Unix throughout the academic and commercial communities. The photo above was described by Ritchie as "an amusing photo" that shows Ken (sitting) and Ritchie (standing) along with a collection of hardware from various computer systems.
